    <h1>Why is visualization effective?</h1>
    <p>Most people grasp the truth of an assessment only when they unequivocally envision the evidence for it, something
      that our kludgy brains alone often can't do well. </p>

    <p>The graphic is about the numbers above, without the graphic we cannot find out
        how the data changes, but with the help of graphic, we can get the change of the
        data clearly.</p>

    <h1>What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks?</h1>
    <p>From hierarchy of elementary perceptual tasks</p>

      <li>position along common scales(left graphic)</li>

    <h1>What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>trade-off between clarity and allure</li>
      <li>an inept graphic in most circumstances may be fruitful in a very specific one</li>
